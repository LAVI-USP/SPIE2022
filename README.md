# Assessment of training strategies for convolutional neural network to restore low-dose digital breast tomosynthesis projections

======

This repository contains the training and testing codes for the paper "[Assessment of training strategies for convolutional neural network to restore low-dose digital breast tomosynthesis projections](https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2609945)", submitted to the [SPIE Medical Imaging 2022](https://spie.org/conferences-and-exhibitions/medical-imaging) conference. We used the OpenVCT from the University of Pennsylvania, available [here](https://sourceforge.net/p/openvct/wiki/Home/). Also, we used a model-based (MB) restoration as a benchmark, also available [here](https://lucasbusp.wixsite.com/lucasborges/image-restoration), which uses the commonly known [BM3D](https://webpages.tuni.fi/foi/GCF-BM3D/).
